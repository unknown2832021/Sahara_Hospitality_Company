    <h1 id="omanHeading">Sultanate of Oman</h1>
    <div class="omanText1">
        <img src="image/aboutOman/oman1.jpg" align="left">
        
    <p id="omanText1">Oman, a vast country in the Gulf region, is blessed with abundant natural beauty and happens to be the oldest independent 
        state in the Arab world.  Although modern in its approach, it is a country which believes in preserving its rich traditions 
        and culture and gives a lot of importance to them. The country has a large expat population who enjoy a modern lifestyle.
        This diversity in climate gives Oman’s winter a special summer sun-warmth across the country’s deserts and cities, a fresh 
        humidity-free breeze with moderate temperatures in Jabal Akhdar, and seasonal wind, showers, rain, clouds, and a refreshing 
        breeze in the Fall season in the Dhofar region.</p>
    <p id="omanText2">The Omani people are friendly and hospitable. Although Arabic is their main language, English is spoken widely. 
        Despite their affable nature, the Omanis are quite conservative. They value their privacy and in particular, 
        hold their religion in the highest regard, expecting due respect for their faith. Modesty is the keyword with regards 
        to clothing. Omani women wear long garments called Abayat, ensuring that they are covered from head to toe and they wear 
        scarves called Lahaf to cover their heads. The men wear long ankle length robes called ‘Dishdasha’ and handmade decorated 
        caps called ‘Qum-ma’. On formal occasions, they wear a turban called ‘Mussar’.

        During the holy month of Ramadan, all Muslims fast during the daylight hours. Visitors to the country should remember 
        that eating, drinking, and smoking in public are not allowed during that time.</p>

 <h1 id="omanHeading">Oman's Natural Heritage</h1>
    <div class="omanText2">
        <img src="image/aboutOman/oman2.jpg" align="right">
        
    <p id="omanText1">Still holding onto its rich heritage, Oman is one of few destinations where visitors can experience the exotic 
        flavors of Arabia without the distorted perspectives of modern-day values. Its embracing community takes pride in having a strong 
        sense of identity and remain loyal to their roots, never forgetting their colorful past and the ancient civilizations that founded 
        this Arabian jewel. As a result, Oman’s gleaming cities are alive with tradition, retaining their historic appeal and Bedouin 
        values. It’s rare to encounter a country that is still rooted in ancient traditions and this, together with abundant natural 
        scenery, makes Oman an exclusive travel option for those seeking a taste of modern-day Arabia while also journeying into its 
        ancient soul. Outside the walls of the more frequently-visited city of Muscat are some enticing destinations, waiting to be 
        discovered, and an extraordinary adventure awaits all who step into this desert kingdom.</p>
    <p id="omanText2">Despite occupying an area that’s only the size of France, the Rub Al Khali desert hosts half as much sand as the 
        entire Sahara. Also called the Empty Quarter because of its lack of settlements, this 660,000 sq km region is the planet’s largest 
        contiguous sand desert. Oman’s portion features fields of linear dunes, whose shapes can shift with the seasonal winds, separated by 
        parched salt flats. From Salalah, travellers can visit the region on an overnight tour that includes driving up and down the dunes, 
        plodding camel rides, a majestic sunset and an inky, black sky chock-full of twinkling stars.</p>
    </div>

    <h1 id="omanHeading">Oman's Food & Drinks</h1>
    <div class="omanText3">
        <img src="image/aboutOman/omanFood.jpg" align="left">   
    <p id="omanText1">The cuisine of Oman is a mixture of Indian, Indonesian, Arab and East African influences. Omani people often use various 
        marinades and spices that result in tasty dishes. Various spices, herbs, onions, garlic and lime are used liberally, but unlike other 
        Arabic cuisines, the food of Oman is not hot. Chicken, mutton and fish serve as main ingredients, often accompanied by rice. The main meal 
        in Oman is usually eaten at midday followed by a light dinner.</p>
    <p id="omanText2">Popular dishes include:<br>
        <strong>Shuwa</strong>: This is a dish traditionally served during festivals. It involves meat that has been 
        seasoned with spices and herbs and then cooked very slowly, sometimes up to two days, in an underground oven. As a result of this process, 
        meat becomes very tender.<br>
        <strong>Maqbous</strong>: This is a rice dish that is yellow courtesy of the saffron used. It is cooked and served over a spicy red 
        or white meat. <br>
        <strong>Mashuai</strong>: This meal consists of a whole spit-roasted kingfish that is then served with lemon rice. <br>
        <strong>Shows</strong>: This is a lamb dish that is cooked in an earth oven for two days with banana and date puree in palm leaves.<br>.</p>
