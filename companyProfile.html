      <h1>Profile Viewpoint</h1>
      <p><strong><a href="index.html">Sahara Hospitality Co. SAOG (SHC)</a></strong> is a joint stock company listed on the Muscat Securities Market in the Sultanate of Oman.
        The founding objective of the company is to build, own and operate permanent accommodation for the contractor community of 
        <strong><a href="https://www.pdo.co.om/en/Pages/Home.aspx">Petroleum 
        Development Oman LLC</a></strong> (largest oil producer in Sultanate of Oman) on contract basis.
        The company has invested R.O 25 M in the development of Permanent Accommodation for Contractors (PAC) facilities under contract to 
        Petroleum Development Oman LLC (PDO) at Fahud (796 rooms), Nimr (845 rooms). The facilities include every amenity for messing, accommodation, 
        recreational and medical care.
        Ever since the commencement of PACs commercial operations in September 2000, the company have posted steady growth.
        Through commitment and professionalized services SHC have won the heart of its business community and today the management can proudly 
        state that the company has established its mission of  “Building an Oasis in the Desert”.</p>
    </div>
<div class="project">
    <h1>The Project</h1>
    <P><strong>PDO</strong> introduced an innovative idea to have permanent accommodation for its contractors’ personnel that include residential, messing, 
        recreational, clinic and other facilities under one roof with a view to standardise the amenities as enjoyed by its own staff at the remote 
        sites and to offer an equal base for various contractors competing for works at oilfields.</P>
    <p>As per PDO PACs tender terms and conditions, SHC had pre-formation of a consortium to enable submission of the bid whereby SHC and another 
        consortium were awarded the contracts from amongst five short listed competing consortia to build, own and operate (BOO) two PACs at each site. </p>
    <p>Initially in the year 2000 at commencement of operations, SHC constructed one PAC each at Fahud and Nimr consisting of 384 and 264 rooms respectively 
        having residential accommodation, dining halls, kitchens, storage for frozen, dry & perishables, recreational facilities including outdoor 
        games, beverage outlets, laundries and clinics appropriately demarcated for use by various levels of residents as relevant</p>
    <br>
    <p>However, in view of increased demand for accommodation, both PACs were extended and additional 256 & 484 rooms were built at Fahud & Nimr 
        respectively during 2008 & 2011 thus making total availability of rooms at Fahud 724 and at Nimr 840. This included also expansion of all 
        catering support facilities, construction of one swimming pool, one squash court and additional car parks at each PAC.</p>
    <p>During 2012, the company was awarded the management and operation of Rima PAC to provide hospitality services for a period of 20 years. 
        The facilities have been developed further with swimming pool and recreation facilities. In view of increase of activities in the area and 
        heavy demand for accommodation, plan is underway to build additional rooms at the current facilities to meet with the prevailing requirement. </p>
</div>
<div class="contract">
    <h1>The Contract</h1>
    <p>PDO Fahud & Nimr PAC contract is for unlimited period and the terms of operation were on fixed rates for the first five years from date of 
        commencement of commercial operations.  For the next five years, the rates were indexed to the predetermined formula based on the general price 
        index for Muscat.  At the end of ten years SHC & PDO are to mutually agree the applicable rates for the future period.</p>
</div>
<div class="serviceProvider">
    <h1>The Service Provider</h1>
    <p><strong><a href="http://aaoman.com.om/">Catering and Supplies Co. LLC </a></strong>has been a member and leader of the consortium and a major founder shareholder of SHC, was awarded a contract 
        with back to back conditions of SHC contract with PDO to provide all required services pertaining to catering, housekeeping, laundry,
